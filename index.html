    <body>
        <h1>This is my level 1 website!</h1>
            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I am a passionate gamer who goes by the name of Mercury! I would like to learn how to develop the things I use daily as a total technology geek! Growing up on Vancouver Island I have a great balance of the outdoors, beauty and splendor as well as time to spend inside with the computer. </p>

             <h2>Is it your first time in post-secondary education?</h2>
                <p>This is my first year in post secondary studies and I am taking a full course load to gain full immersion into the development sphere.</p>

            <h2>Do I have any past experience of creating websites?</h2>
                <p>I have no experience creating websites from code. In grade 8 however I took a robotics class that used a website called "Weebly" to create websites!</p>

            <h2>Do I know any coding languages?</h2>
                <p>I don't currently know any langugages but am learning Java + C along with this course!</p>

            <h2>What are my expectations for this course?</h2>
                <p>My expectations and goals for the end of the course would be to create myself a personal website that I can add professional levels of detail into. Vector graphics, animations, and more. I imagine something similar to old MSN accounts with my own current day twist.</p>
